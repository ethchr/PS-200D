# PS-200D

The goal is to have this be my repository for all of my assignments and projects related to PS 200D for Spring 2017 quarter at UCLA. This will hopefully teach me how to use Github in a productive manner, and may potentially provide support for fellow students in the course if I am able to stay on top of things. That's a pretty big 'if' though. I can hopefully take some time over spring break to figure out some of the basics here, so that I am not grasping at straws come day 1. 

Given that I don't really even know how this course will be structured, I can't exactly say what this repository will look like. When I do, I will update the readme. I assume that there will be separate folders for assignments versus projects, with perhaps an additional folder for notes if I choose to keep them here (I could also scan notes into here if I decide to write them by hand). We will see how this all turns out.
